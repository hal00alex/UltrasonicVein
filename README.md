# UltrasonicVein
Research Project for Fall 2016. 
Going to make a device that lights up when a vein is found. 
It will be useful for training nurses and blood banks. 
Ideally, it will display an ultrasonic image or use a multimodal apporach to generate an image, but the equipment will be kind of expensive
Instead, going to use a 40K ultrasonic sensor and measure the velocity.
